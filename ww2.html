                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The most popular Uncle Sam poster from World War II was created by James Montgomery Flagg, and featured Uncle Sam pointing his finger with the words "I Want You for U.S. Army."</p>
                <p><strong>Significance:</strong> While the image of Uncle Sam was created during World War I, its became widely popular as the representative image of the World War II propaganda. The image of Uncle Sam pointing his finger directly at the viewer with a serious expression serves as a powerful symbol of authority and urgency, aiming to mobilize civilians to join the military or contribute to the war effort in other ways. This poster, like many others from the era, utilizes the familiar figure of Uncle Sam to appeal to a broad audience, leveraging the symbol's historical significance and the trust it commands. The psychological impact of this poster lies in its ability to evoke a sense of duty and responsibility among the population, reinforcing the idea that every citizen has a role to play in the war effort.</p>
