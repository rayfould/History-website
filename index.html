        <h2>Introduction</h2> 
        <p>Welcome to "The Evolution of US Propaganda: From WWI to WWII," an academic exploration of the United States' role in development and the subsequent evolution of propaganda techniques. This exhibition aims to critically examine the transformation of American propaganda from its inception during World War I to its sophisticated manifestations in the subsequent conflict.</p>
        <p>The United States' entry into World War I marked a pivotal moment in the history of propaganda. Initially, American propaganda was characterized by its simplicity and directness, primarily serving to inspire and motivate the populace to support the war effort. This period saw the use of iconic songs, such as "Over There," and the distribution of savings stamps to finance the war, aiming to mobilize troops and resources domestically.</p>
        <p>However, as the war progressed and the United States became more deeply involved, so too did the propaganda strategies. The evolution of American propaganda during World War II reflects a significant shift towards more complex and psychologically nuanced tactics. This period witnessed the employment of fearmongering, the manipulation of public sentiment through the portrayal of the enemy, and the use of psychological warfare techniques to demoralize the opposition.</p>
        <p>The goal of this exhibition is to dissect this evolution, examining how the strategies and techniques of American propaganda evolved from straightforward recruitment and financial mobilization to the sophisticated use of psychological tactics and fearmongering. Through a detailed examination of various artifacts, including posters, films, songs, and newspaper articles, this exhibition seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role and impact of propaganda in shaping public opinion and behavior during these critical periods.</p>
        <p>As you navigate through the exhibition, you will gain insights into the multifaceted nature of propaganda, its evolution over time, and its profound impact on the course of history. This exploration is not just a historical analysis but also a reflection on the power of media and psychology in influencing societal behavior and perceptions.</p>
